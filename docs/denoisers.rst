LLR Denoising Methods
=====================

Patch-denoise implemement several local-low-rank methods, based on singular values thresholding.


Singular Value Thresholding
---------------------------

General Procedure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Consider a sequence of image or volume. From this image, patches are extracted, processed and recombined.

1. Extraction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The extraction of the patch consist of selecting a spatial region of the image, and take all the time information associated to this region.
The patch is then flatten in a 2D Matrix (so called Casorati matrix). A row represents the temporal evolution of a single voxel, and a column is the flatten image at a specific time point.
Moreover, a mask, defining a Region of Interest (ROI) can be used to determined is a patch should be processed or not (and save computations).

.. warning::
    The size of the patch and the overlapping are the main factor for computational cost. Moreover for the SVD-based process to work well, it is required to have a "tall" matrix , i.e. that the number of row is greater than the number of column.

2. Processing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each patch is processed, by applying a threshold function on the centered singular value decomposition of the :math:`M \times N` patch:

.. math::

    X = U S V^T + M

Where :math:`M = \langle X \rangle` is the mean of each row of :math:`X`, and :math:`U,S,V^T` is the SVD decomposition of :math:`X-M`.
In particular, :math:`S=\mathrm{diag}(\sigma_1, \dots, \sigma_n)`

The processing of the singular values by a threshold function :math:`\eta(\sigma_i) = \sigma_i'` yields  new (typically sparser) singular values :math:`S'`

Then the processed patch is defined as:

.. math::

    \hat{X} = U \mathcal{T}(S) V^T + M

3. Recombination
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The recombination of processed patches uses weights associated to each patch after its processing to determine the final value in case of patch overlapping.
Currently three recombination are considered:

- Identical weights. The patches values for a pixel are averaged together (available with ``recombination='average'``)

- Sparse Patch promotion. The patches values are for a pixel are average with weights :math:`\theta`. This Weighted method comes from [1]_ (available with ``recombination='weighted'``), let :math:`P` the number of patch overlapping for voxel :math:`x_i`, and :math:`\hat{x_i}(p)` the value  associated to each patch. the final value of pixel :math:`\hat{x_i}` is

.. math::
   \hat{x_i} = \frac{\sum_{p=1}^P\theta_p\hat{x_j}(p)}{\sum_{p=1}^P\theta_p} \quad \text{where } \theta_p = \frac{1}{1+\|S'_p\|_0}

The more the processed patch :math:`S'_p` is sparse, the bigger the weight associated to it.

- Use the center of patch. In the case of maximally overlapping patches, the patch center value is use for the corresponding pixel.

        For the generic patch processing algorithm.

Raw Singular Value Thresholding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For raw singular value thresholding, the threshold function is simply a hard threshold on the singular value, according to a provided threshold.

.. math::
   \eta_\tau(\sigma_i) = \begin{cases}
   \sigma_i & \text{if}\quad \sigma_i > \tau \\
   0 & \text{otherwise}
   \end{cases}

   :class:`~patch_denoise.space_time.lowrank.RawSVDDenoiser`
        For the implementation.

MP-PCA Thresholding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MP-PCA [2]_ uses the Marshenko-Pastur distribution to find a threshold for each patch. In particular, the noise variance is estimated from the eigen values (squared singular values) and uses to determined the threshold. (See equations 10-12 in reference).


.. seealso::
   :class:`~patch_denoise.space_time.lowrank.MPPCADenoiser`

Hybrid PCA
~~~~~~~~~~

Hybrid-PCA [3]_ uses an a priori spatial distribution of the noise variance, and the singular values are selected such that the discarded one have a mean less or equal to this a priori.

.. seealso::
    :class:`~patch_denoise.space_time.lowrank.HybridPCADenoiser`


NORDIC
~~~~~~

NORDIC [4]_ makes the assumptions that the image noise level is uniform (for instance by pre processing the image and dividing it by an externally available g-map). The threshold is determined by taking the average of  maximum singular value of a set of randomly generated matrix with the dimension as the flattened patch. The uniform noise level must also be provided.

Optimal Thresholding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An optimal thresholding of the singular values [5]_ is also possible associated with a specific norm (Frobenius, nuclear norm or operator norm).

.. seealso::
   :class:`~patch_denoise.space_time.lowrank.OptimalSVDDenoiser`

Adaptive Thresholding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Extending the possibility of optimal thresholding using SURE in presence of noise variance estimation [6]_.
